# Coursera_Capstone
Capstone project for IBM data science

This capstone project involves accident severity data from Seattle's department of transportation. The Introduction and Data files are separated for purposes of grading each individually. These sections will be included in the final file. The project involves exploring the data provided and gaining insights into details about collisions in the city of Seattle. It will also build a predictive model that will categorize accident severity based on out of sample data.
